This project is a Point of Sale (POS) system for a fictional coffee stand.  The design was focused on touch screen capabilities.  The program utilizes simplistic checkout methods, the code needs to be expanded to work with a POS cash drawer and a credit card processing API.  The software includes some basic administration.  Information is stored in a database.
